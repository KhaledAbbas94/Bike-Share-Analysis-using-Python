# BikeShare Analysis with a Python script

## Overview
This project involves exploring bike share systems' data for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Utilizing Python, the code imports data, computes descriptive statistics and creates an interactive terminal experience for users to explore the bike share usage patterns.

## Project Details
### Bike Share Data
Bicycle-sharing systems have become popular, and this project analyzes data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider, for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The dataset includes start time, end time, trip duration, start station, end station, user type, gender, and birth year.

### Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 is provided for all three cities. The data files contain core columns, with additional columns in Chicago and New York City files.

### Statistics Computed
The Python script computes various descriptive statistics, including popular travel times, popular stations and trips, trip duration, and user information.

## Files
